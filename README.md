# TECHNICAL PART
# Goat Nft Project
This project descibes the functionalities of the Goat NFT project, including minting, setting the token URL, storing images to Pinata (IPFS), and running tests. It comes with the NFT Contract, a contract test, and a script that deploys and interacts with the contract. The project is tested on local development network and the BSC testnet.

## Getting Started
### Requirements
* Pip and pipx
* Brownie
* 

### QuickStart
To clone the repo, run the following command in your shell:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Undiscoveredgoats/goat_nft.git
```

To install dependencies and packages, run either of the following commands:

```
yarn install
```

or

```
npm install
```
Make sure you have an eth account whih has link and tBNB on Bsc-test network. Set the `PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env` as shown in `.envexample`.
To be able to upload images to Pinata, set the `PINATA_API_SECRET` and `PINATA_API_KEY` variables on scripts/UPLOAD_TO_PINATA.py as obtained from [Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager#) by logging in and generating new keys. Also create and fund chainlink vrf subscription on bsc testnet [here](https://vrf.chain.link/chapel/) and set the subscription id on brownie-config.yaml as directed, to be able to use chainlink randomness on goat contract.
You can also customize the goat mint fees on brownie-config.yaml

### Compiling contracts

```
brownie run scripts/deploy_goat.py
```


### Deploying Goat

To deploy `fuchaContract` on the Hardhat dev network, run the following command:

```
brownie run scripts/deploy_goat.py
```
This script will deploy goat, add goat to consumer, mint a randomn nft, create metadata, upload both the image and metadata to both Ipfs and Pinata, set the token metadata uri on the minted goat Id, and finally withdraw half of the goat's balance to your account.

#### Deploying on Bsc testnet
To deploy `goat` to the bsc testnet, run the followinng command:

```
brownie run scripts/deploy_goat --network bsc-test
```
This script will deploy goat, add goat to consumer, mint a randomn nft, create metadata, upload both the image and metadata to both Ipfs and Pinata, set the token metadata uri on the minted goat Id, and finally withdraw half of the goat's balance to your account on bsc testnet.

#### Viewing the and metadata on Ipfs
Here are the uploaded images and their metadata on ipfs
